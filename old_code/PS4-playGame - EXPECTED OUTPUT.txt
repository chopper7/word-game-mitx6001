About the Output:
Be sure to inspect the above sample output carefully - very little is actually printed out in
this function specifically. Most of the printed output actually comes from the code you wrote
in playHand - be sure that your code is modular and uses function calls to the playHand
helper function!

You should also make calls to the dealHand helper function. You shouldn't make calls to
any other helper function that we've written so far - in fact, this function can be written
in about 15-20 lines of code.

Here is the output with the output from playHand obscured:
